Xpath:

absolute xpath   --> starts with / and the root node (it is not widely used becuase the tree might                             change)
2.Relative Xpath

  a.Attribute
      a.1   //tagname[@attribute='value']

      Contains  methods in attribute
      a.2   //tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

      startsWith  method in attribute

      a.3  //tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]


  b.Text
      b.1   //tagname[text()="value"]

       Contains  methods in attribute

      b.2  //tagname[contains(text(), 'partial attribute value')]

       startsWith  method in text

       b.3 //tagname[starts-with(text(), 'partial starting attribute value')]


 Notes:
     1.if u are unable to write down the unqiue xpath (no matter u tried to use various avialable xpath)
     then u can use
        Indexing to select your desired one


(//tagname[@attribute='value'])[index Number]    ---> Index number starts with 1


use the contains or strats with only when
the text or attribute is  containing a dynamic  part  and u are left with no other option


the text or attribute is long enough (and you are sure that it will always remian unique)
